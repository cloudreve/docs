## What is Cloudreve?

Cloudreve allows you to quickly build a public and private network disk system. Cloudreve supports different cloud storage platforms at the bottom layer, and users do not need to care about the physical storage method in actual use. You can use Cloudreve to build a personal network disk, a file sharing system, or a public cloud system for large and small groups.
