# Upgrade from 3.x.x

The upgrade steps in the V3 version are relatively simple, and the overall process is as follows:

1. Back up the database;
2. Download or build the latest version of Cloudreve;
3. Stop the running Cloudreve;
4. Replace the old version of Cloudreve main program with the new version;
5. Start Cloudreve;
6. Clear the browser cache;
7. If you are using Cloudreve slave mode, please also replace the Cloudreve of the slave node with the same version.

If you used self-built front-end static resource files in the old version, please rebuild with the corresponding front-end warehouse code of the new version.
