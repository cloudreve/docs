#WebDAV

WebDAV is a file transfer protocol based on the HTTP protocol. Nowadays, many third-party file managers, video players and other products support accessing files in Cloudreve through the WebDAV protocol. You can use this to achieve cross-platform file sharing and synchronization.

To use WebDAV, please go to the background management panel to enable WebDAV permission for the corresponding user group. The account used by WebDAV and the Cloudreve account **do not interoperate** and need to be created separately. Go to the foreground Navigate to the left - WebDAV - Create New Account Create account information for WebDAV use. After the creation is complete, the system will automatically generate a password for this account. When using WebDAV, please use the registered email address as the account name, and the password is the password generated by the above system.

When creating a WebDAV account, you can specify a relative root directory for this account, and this account can only access directories and files under the specified relative root directory through WebDAV. For the donation version, users can also mount different storage strategies for different directories. When uploading new files under WebDAV, the storage strategy mounted for the directory will be used first.

## Common client instructions

### Use Windows Explorer (not recommended)

{% hint style="info" %}
Before using this method, make sure your Cloudreve site has HTTPS enabled. If you need to add it under a non-HTTPS protocol, you need to modify the registry `\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters` to change the value of `BasicAuthLevel` to `2`.
{% endhint %}

Right-click on the blank space of "This PC" and select "Add a network location":

Enter the WebDAV connection address of the site. The general format is `https://your domain name/dav`. After filling, enter your Cloudreve account and the account password generated by the system.

Known issue: After restarting, the added WebDAV mount cannot be accessed, and the account password needs to be re-entered. This is because Windows no longer supports storing WebDAV account and password information under BasicAuth ([Related instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/cannot-automatically-reconnect-dav -share)). Cloudreve will replace the WebDAV authentication method in subsequent versions to improve this problem.
