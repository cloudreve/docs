# S3 compatible

Through the AWS S3 storage policy, you can use Cloudreve to connect to all storage platforms compatible with the AWS S3 protocol. This article will introduce [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) and [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/) two platforms docking method.

{% hint style="warning" %}
S3 storage policies are only available for personal use or for use by trusted groups. Due to the lack of a unified callback mechanism, users can skip Cloudreve's records and upload files to storage buckets.
{% endhint %}

## S3 API compatibility requirements

Cloudreve utilizes the following S3 APIs, please make sure your storage platform is compatible and implements the following APIs.

### Bucket Level

* [PutBucketCors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API\_PutBucketCors.html) is optional and is used to assist in configuring CORS policies. If this API is not implemented, you can also configure it manually .

### Object Level

* [ListObjects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API\_ListObjects.html) Optional, used to import external files in the background.
* [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API\_CreateMultipartUpload.html)
* [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API\_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)
* [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API\_AbortMultipartUpload.html)
* [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API\_UploadPart.html)
* [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API\_GetObject.html)
* [DeleteObjects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API\_DeleteObjects.html)
* [HeadObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API\_HeadObject.html)

## Backblaze B2

Go to [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) to create an account, click "Create a Bucket" to create a Bucket. You can choose Public or Private Bucket according to your needs. Private Bucket is recommended to improve security. After naming the bucket, keep other parameters as default, and click Create Bucket.

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt="" data-size="original">

Add the AWS S3 storage policy in the Cloudreve management panel, and fill in the Bucket name you created. According to the Bucket type, if it is Private, please select "Block All Public Access", and if Public, please select "Allow Public Read". Find the Endpoint of the Bucket on the B2 management panel, add `https://` to its head, and add the Bucket name to the end to fill in Cloudreve:

Fill in the region to which the Bucket belongs in Cloudreve, which can be judged by the Endpoint. For example, the area code of Endpoint `s3.us-west-004.backblazeb2.com` is `us-west-004`. You cannot find the corresponding region in the drop-down menu provided by Cloudreve, just fill in the region code directly.

Click "Add a New Application Key" in Account -> App Keys on the B2 panel, fill in the name of any Key, select the Bucket you just created, and keep other parameters as default:

After creation, fill `keyID` into `AccessKey`; `applicationKey` into `SecretKey`:

Continue to fill in the storage policy configuration, and when you get to step 5, click Let Cloudreve help you create a CORS policy:

At this point, you can bind and use the newly created B2 storage policy.

## Cloudflare R2

### Option 1: Private Bucket

Go to [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/) to purchase a package to activate R2 service. After the Bucket is created, add the AWS S3 storage policy in the Cloudreve management panel and fill in the name of the created Bucket, select the Bucket type as "block all public access", and fill in the Endpoint address provided by Cloudflare (**Bucket name that needs to be removed from the end Manually delete **), the Endpoint format is selected as "mandatory path format":

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



Fill in `auto` in the fifth Bucket area code:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

Go to the home page of the R2 service panel, go to "Manage R2 API Tokens" to create a set of API Tokens, select permission to allow editing, and set the validity period of the certificate according to the requirements:

{% hint style="info" %}
After the API Token expires, please generate a new Token and fill it in the corresponding storage policy of Cloudreve.
{% endhint %}

Fill the AccessKey and SecretKey into Cloudreve after creation:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Continue to fill in the storage policy configuration, and when you get to step 5, click Let Cloudreve help you create a CORS policy:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

At this point, you can bind and use the newly created R2 storage policy.

### Choice 2: Public Bucket

If you need to use a public Bucket, the configuration process is roughly the same as [#xuan-ze-1private-bucket](s3.md#xuan-ze-1private-bucket "mention"), where the additional operations are:

Enable Public Access in the R2 Bucket settings, and then fill in the storage policy information in Cloudreve. Among them, the Bucket type is selected as "Allow public reading"; the Endpoint format is selected as "Host name first"; select "Use CDN" and fill in the Public Bucket URL just obtained (don't forget to remove the `https` at the beginning):

Other configurations should be consistent with those of the Public Bucket.
