# storage policy

Storage policies define storage platforms, uploads, and functional restrictions for files. A user group is bound to a storage policy, and users under this user group will share the same storage policy. In the Pro version, you can specify multiple storage policies for a single user group, and users can switch storage policies freely.

In Cloudreve's file system, each file has its corresponding storage policy recorded, and users can own and manage files with multiple storage policies at the same time. After switching the storage policy of the user group, the uploaded files will not be affected.
