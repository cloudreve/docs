# WebDAV

WebDAV is an HTTP-based file transfer protocol. Many third-party file managers, video players, and other products now support accessing files in Cloudreve via the WebDAV protocol, allowing you to share and synchronize files across platforms.

To use WebDAV, please go to the backend administration panel and enable WebDAV access for the corresponding user group; the account used for WebDAV is not interoperable with the Cloudreve account and needs to be created separately. Go to the frontend and navigate to the left side - WebDAV - Create New Account to create the account information for WebDAV. Once created, the system will automatically generate a password for this account. When using WebDAV, please use your registered email address as the account name and the password will be the one generated by the system above.

When creating a WebDAV account, you can specify the relative root directory for this account, and this account can only access the directories and files under the specified relative root directory through WebDAV. For the donation version, users can also mount different storage policies for different directories, and the storage policy mounted for the directory will be used first when uploading new files under WebDAV.

## Common client usage instructions

### Using Windows Explorer (not recommended)

{% hint style="info" %}
Before using this method, make sure your Cloudreve site is HTTPS enabled. If you need to add it under a non-HTTPS protocol, you need to modify the registry `\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\ Parameters` change the value of `BasicAuthLevel` to `2`.
{% endhint %}

Right click in the "This computer" space and select "Add a network location":

Enter the site WebDAV connection address, usually in the format of `https://ServerIP/dav`, and enter your Cloudreve account and system-generated account password when you are done.

Known issue: The added WebDAV mount cannot be accessed after a reboot and the account password needs to be re-entered. This is because Windows no longer supports storing WebDAV account and password information under BasicAuth ([Related](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/cannot-automatically-reconnect-dav-share)). Cloudreve will change the WebDAV authentication method in a future release to improve this issue.
