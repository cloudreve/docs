## What is Cloudreve?

Cloudreve enables you to quickly set up a cloud storage system that serves both public and private needs. Cloudreve supports different cloud storage platforms at its core, and users don't need to worry about the physical storage method during actual use. You can use Cloudreve to build a personal cloud drive, file sharing system, or even a public cloud system for small to large organizations.

Cloudreve itself is a "cloud drive" rather than a "manager for other cloud drives". Most of its supported storage providers are storage-specific products from public clouds, not cloud drives aimed at individual consumers. The following scenarios are **not suitable** for Cloudreve:

- I need to use Cloudreve to manage files across multiple cloud drives;
- I want to manage files stored in Cloudreve simultaneously with other file managers;
- I want to "redistribute" other cloud storage services to my users;
