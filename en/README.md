## Welcome

## What is Cloudreve?

Cloudreve allows you to quickly set up both public and private drives. Cloudreve supports different cloud storage platforms under the hood, so you don't have to worry about the physical storage. You can use Cloudreve for personal use, for file sharing, or as a public cloud for small or large groups.
