# Upgrade from 3.x.x

The upgrade steps within the V3 release are relatively simple and the overall process is as follows.

1. Back up the database.
2. Download or build the latest version of Cloudreve.
3. Stop the running Cloudreve.
4. Replace the old version of Cloudreve main application with the new version.
5. Start Cloudreve.
6. Clear your browser cache.
7. If you are using Cloudreve in slave mode, replace the Cloudreve on the slave node with the same version.
